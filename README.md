# GoByte Improvement Proposals (GIPs)

GIP stands for Gobyte Improvement Proposal. Similar to Bitcoin's [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/), a GIP is a design document providing information to the Gobyte community, or describing a new feature for Gobyte or its processes or environment. The GIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

Because Gobyte is forked from the Dash codebase, many of the DIPs can be applied to Gobyte as well. The purpose of the GIPs is not to duplicate those which exist as DIPs, but to introduce protocol upgrades or feature specifications which are unique to Gobyte.


## Contributions

We use the same general guidelines for introducing a new GIP as specified in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki), with a few differences. Specifically:

* Instead of the BIP editor, initiate contact with the Gobyte Core development team and your request should be routed to the GIP editor(s). The GIP workflow mimics the DIP workflow.
* Recommended licenses include the MIT license
* Markdown format is the preferred format for GIPs
* Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the GIPs git repository as a pull request. This draft must be written in BIP/DIP style as described in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki), and named with an alias such as "gip-joellucas-infinitegobyte" until the editor has assigned it a GIP number (authors MUST NOT self-assign GIP numbers).
